- **Who are the founders of the company?** Edward Mehr and a silent partner who is not listed. (Google AI generated answers)
- **How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?** When he was working at SpaceX he decided he wanted to make a big impact with AI powered robotics. (Google AI generated answers)
- **How is the company funded?** The company was funded by fundraisers and investors. (Google AI generated answers)

## Business Activities

- **What specific problem is the company or project trying to solve?** The forming, measuring, trimming, drilling, and finishing of sheet metal in the manufacturing industry. (Machina labs website https://machinalabs.ai/)
- **Who is the company's intended customer?** Any manufacturer who deals with sheet metal.
- **Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?** There are sheet metal manufacturers all over the world. Without sheet metal manufacturers we would not have vehicles of any kind, no cars, planes, boats, trains, nothing. We would not have the machines that are used in Machine shops, we would not have stainless steel appliances, we would not have a large majority of the things we take for granted daily. The market is extremely large. (Personal experience in manufacturing)
- **What solution does this company offer that their competitors do not or cannot offer?** The thing that sets them apart from their main competitor, Grey Matter Robotics, is that they form the metal, whereas grey matter does not have that capability. (Machina labs https://machinalabs.ai/ and Grey Matter Robotics website https://graymatter-robotics.com/)
- **Which technologies are they currently using, and how are they implementing them?** They use a variety of technologies. They use machine learning, AI driven sensors for gathering data and manipulating sheet metal, they create digital twins of the parts they are creating, they use models “random forest” and “Bayesian Models” to detect defects and forecast maintenance, and they use deep learning models to guide robots in fabricating parts quickly and precisely.

## Landscape

- **What field is the company in?** Sheet metal manufacturing.
- **What have been the major trends and innovations in this field over the last 5 to 10 years?** The most common trend is the addition of robotics to eliminate manual labor. With the elimination of manual labor, we will see improved quality, reduced scrap, and increased speed and efficiency. The sheet metal industry has remained the same for almost 40 years until the introduction of robotics.
- **What are the other major companies in this field?** Currently there are two sheet metal focused companies, listed above, however, there are dozens of robotics companies that allow for lights out manufacturing using CNC machines. These robots focus on loading, unloading, and operating the Machine in place of an operator. However, they still need an operator to prepare and stage the materials to be machined, and to remove and check the parts after they have been placed in the finished parts bins. I have operated these types of robots, and they allow for better efficiency and free up the operator’s time to run more machines with this setup.

## Results

- **What has been the business impact of this company so far?** Increased productivity, increased quality, all the goals they had in mind have been met and they are now improving on them all.
- **What are some of the core metrics that companies in this field use to measure success?** Parts per hour is the main metric. The more parts completed, the more money they make. The less labor needed, the better.
- **How is your company performing based on these metrics?** Extremely well.
- **How is your company performing relative to competitors in the same field?** I feel they are doing better as they do more than their competitors. They not only finish the surface with grinding, but they also bend the material, whereas their competitors only finish the surface.

## Recommendations

- **If you were to advise the company, what products or services would you suggest they offer?** I would suggest they also dip into operating the CNC machines, with the ability to set up the machines and load the cutting programs onto the machines. This would eliminate a lot of the manual labor we as Machinists still have to do when working with robots. Currently, robots can only load, unload, and press start. If they were equipped with the technology to set up the machine and load the programs, it would save hours of operator’s time.
- **Why do you think that offering this product or service would benefit the company?** I know every manufacturer I have ever worked for wants lights out manufacturing and this would create a true lights-out manufacturing environment.
- **What technologies would this additional product or service utilize?** It would have to utilize the same AI deep learning technology as every setup is different and the work that goes into ensuring precision requires a skill set that can only be learned by doing it. So, they would have to have the ability to adapt and learn better methods to increase efficiency.
- **Why are these technologies appropriate for your solution?** The CNC Machinists are a dying breed with more retiring than entering the field. There are not enough of us, and most of the new ones are unskilled, which delays production and increases scrap. This technology would eliminate the need for the Skill trade and provide a new opportunity of skilled labor. It would increase productivity, decrease costs, and decrease scrap rate. It would decrease the need for new machinists. But increase the need for robotics maintenance. So, one job ends but another begins.
